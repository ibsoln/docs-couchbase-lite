DOC-6340-H2-P2P: New topic - Implementing P2P Sync
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/DOC-6340

This is the how-to for P2P snc using websockets

== Introduction

ifeval::["{page-edition}"=="{enterprise}"]
.Enterprise Edition only
IMPORTANT: Peer-to-peer sync is an {url-enterprise} feature.
You must purchase the Enterprise License which includes official {url-support-policy} to use it in production (also see the {url-license-and-supp-faq}).
endif::[]

This content provides sample code covering the implementation of peer-to-peer sync over websockets. Specifically it covers the implementation of an {glos-term-active-peer}, that will initiate replication with a {glos-term-passive-peer}.

The code snippet in <<simple-replication-to-listener>> covers the configuration, initialization and replication is expanded upon in subsequent sections in this content.

== API References

You can find {url-api-references}[{param-title} API References] here.

== Device Discovery
*This phase is optional:* If the listener is initialized on a well known URL endpoint (for example, a static IP Address or well known DNS address) then you can configure active peers to connect to those.

Prior to connecting with a listener you may execute a peer discovery phase to dynamically discover peers.

// For the active peer this involves browsing-for and selecting the appropriate service using a zero-config protocol such as _Bonjour_.
For the active peer this involves browsing-for and selecting the appropriate service using a zero-config protocol such as _Network Service Discovery_ -- see: https://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/nsd.

// image::ROOT:replication.svg[,800]

== Configure Replicator
In this section: <<configure-target>>  |  <<sync-mode>>  |  <<listener-authentication>>  | <<client-authentication>>

=== Configure Target
Use the
{url-api-class-replicator-config} class and {url-api-constructor-replicator-config-db-tgt} constructor to initialize the replication configuration.

This constructor provides the passive peer's database and endpoint details -- whether pre-configured or gathered during a discovery phase.

The required parameters are:

* The local database to be synced.
* The database URL including the port the listener is listening on.
The URL scheme for web socket URLs uses `ws:` (non-TLS) or `wss:` (SSL/TLS) prefixes.

You will also need any security credentials provided (for example, user name and password or Cert) for use in the authentication phase of configuration.

====

=== Sync Mode

Use `{url-api-class-replicator-config}` class's {url-api-prop-replicator-config-rep-type} and
`{url-api-prop-replicator-config-cont}` parameters, to tell the replicator:

* The direction of the replication: `*pushAndPull*`; `pull`; `push`
* Whether the replicator should:
** Stay active indefinitely to replicate changed documents: `continuous=true`
** Be a one-shot replication of changed documents: `continuous=false`

=== Listener Authentication

:this-prop: setAcceptOnlySelfSignedServerCertificate
Use `{url-api-class-replicator-config}`, with its {url-api-prop-replicator-config-AcceptOnlySelfSignedServerCertificate} parameter, to tell the replicator how to verify TLS server certificates.

If {this-prop} is `false` (default) then only CA Certificates are accepted.

If {this-prop} is `true` then only Self-Signed  Certificates are accepted.

// :this-prop: ServerCertificateVerificationMode

// Use `{url-api-class-replicator-config}`, with its {url-api-prop-replicator-config-ServerCertificateVerificationMode} parameter, to tell the replicator how to verify TLS server certificates.

// The valid options at this stage are:

// * `selfSignedCert` -- Verify by accepting any (and only) self-signed certificates; non-self-signed certificates will be rejected
// * `caCert` -- Verify by using trusted anchor CA certificates or by using the configured pinned server certificates.
// This is the default mode

// See: {url-api-enum-replicator-config-ServerCertificateVerificationMode}

=== Client Authentication

Use {url-api-class-replicator-config}'s {url-api-prop-replicator-config-auth} method to define the authentication method to the replicator - see <<configuring-client-authentication>>.

Valid authenticators include:

* The `{url-api-class-replicator-config-basic-auth}` to use basic authentication with the username and password credentials.

* The `{url-api-class-replicator-config-cert-auth}` parameter to configure the client TLS certificates to be presented to the server, on connection. This applies only to the {url-api-class-urlendpointlistener}.

If you are using certificates, you have the option to either:

* Use Couchbase Lite's convenience API to create self-signed certificates.
The `{url-api-class-tlsidentity}` class provides methods to manage identities.
* Bring your own certificate.
Our convenience API also gives you the flexibility to bring your own TLS identities, using the `{url-api-method-tls-identity-import}` method.
+
This makes it easy to bundle PKCS12 certificates with your application.

// See {xref-cbl-pg-p2p-manage-tls-id} for more on how to do this.

== Initialize Replicator

Use the `{url-api-class-replicator}` class's {url-api-constructor-replicator-init-config} constructor, to initialize the replicator with the configuration you have defined.
You can, optionally, add a change listener (see <<monitor-sync>>) before starting the replicator running using {url-api-method-replicator-start}.

----

== Monitor Sync

=== Change Listeners
Use the {url-api-class-replicator} class to add a change listener as a callback to the Replicator ({url-api-method-replicator-add-change-listener}) -- see <<monitor-replication>>.
You will then be asynchronously notified of state changes.
Use this to monitor changes and to inform on sync progress, as shown below; this is an optional step.

=== Replicator Status
You can also use {url-api-property-replicator-status} to monitor replicator status.
That is, when it is actively transferring data and when it has stopped.

The {url-api-class-replicator-status} structure comprises the following elements:

* {url-api-enum-replicator-activity} -- stopped, offline, connecting, idle or busy
* {url-api-enum-replicator-progress}
** completed The total number of changes completed
** total -- the total number of changes to be processed
* {url-api-enum-replicator-error} -- the current error, if any

For more on replication status, see: {xref-cbl-pg-replication--status}

TIP: If you added an optional change listener (see <<monitor-sync>> for how) you should also remove it using the {url-api-method-replicator-rmv-change-listener} method.

== Conflict Resolution

Couchbase Lite's default conflict resolution policy is applied -- see {xref-cbl-pg-conflict-auto}.
To use a different policy, specify a _conflict resolver_ using {url-api-prop-replicator-config-conflict} -- see: {xref-cbl-pg-conflict-custom}.

//TODO: Update example to show how the confog resolver parameter is set (refer to the stanadrd replicator code)

.Conflict resolving

For more on replicator conflict resolution see: {xref-cbl-pg-conflict}.

== Delta Sync
// DONE: Add reference to listener section tht includes enableDeltaSync parameter being set to true
If delta sync is enabled on the listener, then replication will use delta sync.

// For more on how to:

// * Enable delta sync on the listener -- see: {xref-cbl-pg-dbo-p2psync-websocket-using-passive--delta-sync}
